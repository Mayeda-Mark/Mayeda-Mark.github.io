        <p>Here you will find a collection of some of the projects that I made for school which display a few of my capabilities.</p>
        <a href="https://afternoon-citadel-20086.herokuapp.com/">Back Door Bakery</a>
        <p>This is a website/web application I made for my sister in-law's bakery.  The bakery is now closed (unrelated to the website) which is why the site is only up on heroku.  This application was built using Node.js, handlebars and pSQL.  The application has a seperate section only accessible via logging in through session authentication.  From this area, authorized users can update the blog and calendar events via tools that I built to access the pSQL database which stored the blog posts and calendar events.</p>
