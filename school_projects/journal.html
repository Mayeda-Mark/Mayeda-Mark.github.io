	<h1>Journal Assignment</h1>
	<p>Over the course of this semester, We have worked a lot on various topics involved in mobile application development and design.  While each of these topics are extremely useful tools, I will not be focusing on these as I discussed what I learned and what skills I've gained over the course of this semester.  Instead, I plan on focusing more on the lessons and skills that I have gained this semester which will help me throughout whatever career path I take in software engineering.</p>
