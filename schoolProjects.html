        <h1>School Projects</h1>
        <p>Below, you will find varoius projects which I made for school and a brief explanation of what each project is:</p>
        <a href="/school_projects/Loops.html">Loop and conditional statements:</a>
        <p>This applicaiton is built with vanilla front-end javaScript which allows a user to input a number to generate a multiplacation table of that size and input a number to view multiples of that number.</p>
        <br>
        <a href="/school_projects/Objects.html">Objects:</a>
        <p>This is a simple application where a user can enter a football team name and their win/loss record.  The application then writes this information into an object and then reads the information back in a complete sentence.</p>
        <br>
        <a href="/school_projects/JSON.html">JSON/Stringify:</a>
        <p>This application is very similar to the objects application, except that it uses JSON and stringify() to generate the statement inputed by the user.</p>
        <br>
        <a href="/school_projects/XMLHTTP.html">XMLHTTP:</a>
        <p>This application makes a simple XMLHTTP request and displays some of the information found to the user.</p>
        <br>
        <a href="/school_projects/localstorage.html">Local storage:</a>
        <p>This application is a demonstration of using local storage.  The user inputs their name and refreshes the page.  The page then greets the user by name.  The user can also "pick a card" which will then be stored and read back to the user from local storage.</p>
        <br>
        <a href="/school_projects/dommanip.html">Domain manipulation:</a>
        <p>Here, domain manipulation is used to generate a user's shopping list and a number of admitedly silly buttons. </p>
        <br>
        <a href="/school_projects/javacss.html">CSS manipulation through javaScript:</a>
        <p>This application uses javaScriptto change the page's CSS through user input.</p>
        <br>
        <a href="/school_projects/animate.html">Animate:</a>
        <p>This application makes a simple animation from some text on the screen.</p>
        <br>
        <a href="/school_projects/JSEvents.html">javaScript events:</a>
        <p>This applicaiton uses javaScript events to make simple changes to the page's CSS.</p>
        <br>
        <a href="/school_projects/tags.html">Tags/Canvas:</a>
        <p>This application demonstrates the use of video and audio tags in a web applicaiton and demonstrates the use of a canvas to make a smiley face.</p>
        <br>
        <a href="/school_projects/tansition.html">Tansitions:</a>
        <p>This applicaiton demonstrates the use of CSS transitions to manipulate html elements.</p>
        <br>

        <br>
        <a href="/school_projects/animatecss.html">Animate with transforms:</a>
        <p>Similar to animate, this demonstrates animations with tranfroms and transitions using CSS and javaScript.</p>
        <br>
